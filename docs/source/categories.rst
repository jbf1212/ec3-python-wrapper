Categories Queries
==================

The EC3Categories class can be used for retrieving Categories in the EC3 database.

EC3 Categories represent the categories as EC3 has defined and organized them for their interface.
These categories will not map 1:1 with other systems such as Masterformat.

Current functionality provides the ability to get the entire category tree as well as categories by id.
