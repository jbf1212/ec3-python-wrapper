Project Queries
==================

The EC3Projects class can be used for retrieving project records in the EC3 database.

Usage of this class assumes that you have projects setup already in your EC3 account.
The simplest method for returning projects will likely be by using the get_project_by_name method.

Users should refer to the EC3 documentation for the field names and values expected for projects.
