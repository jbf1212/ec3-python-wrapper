### Inspiration

Obviously none of this would exist without the amazing efforts of the [Building Transparency](https://buildingtransparency.org/ec3) team and the database they've been gathering.

Much of how this library has been structured was modeled off of the great work done on the [pyAirtable module](https://github.com/gtalarico/pyairtable).
