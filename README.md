### Usage Example

Some Jupyter Notebook examples are provided here:

Overview of some available functions: [ec3_overview.ipynb](ec3_overview.ipynb)
Querying and plotting materials: [ec3_materials_plot.ipynb](ec3_materials_plot.ipynb)

## Credits

* Obviously none of this would exist without the great efforts of the [Building Transparency](https://buildingtransparency.org/ec3) team and the EC3 database.
* Much of how this library has been structured was modeled off of the amazing work done on the [pyAirtable module](https://github.com/gtalarico/pyairtable).
